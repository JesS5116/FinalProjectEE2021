   ** Warning ** An AirflowNetwork:Multizone:Surface object has an air-flow opening corresponding to
   **   ~~~   ** window or door = TVS_JORGE, which is within 
   **   ~~~   ** 10 deg of being horizontal. Airflows through large horizontal openings are poorly
   **   ~~~   ** modeled in the AirflowNetwork model resulting in only one-way airflow.
   ** Warning ** An AirflowNetwork:Multizone:Surface object has an air-flow opening corresponding to
